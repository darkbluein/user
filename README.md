## Overview

Locality is a mobile app that allows users to order groceries or any retail item from their local retail store. The app also has a feature that lets users maintain their khaata (running account) at their trusted retail stores and choose appropriate delivery time according to their necessity.

Our app is designed with your convenience in mind. Weâ€™ve made it easy to navigate and order items with just a few taps. You can search for specific items, filter by category, or simply browse through our curated list of popular products. Our user-friendly interface ensures that anyone can use the app without any hassle.

Simply download the app and order everything you need from the comfort of your home. You can browse through thousands of items available in your local store, add them to your cart, and choose the most convenient delivery time according to your schedule.

This app is built majorly using React Native, Graphql, react-native-ui-lib, and Redux.
